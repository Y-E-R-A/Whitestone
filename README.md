Whitestone is an audio and voting web application designed for use in the Academic Senate of
the University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez Campus. The purpose of this file is to provide key
guidance to the individuals within the organzation who are responsible for the installation
and maintenance of the Whitestone application.

Prerequisites

What is needed in order to install Whitestone?
-An Apache web server running on a CentOS 7 or RHEL 7 distribution
-The PostgreSQL database service
-Python 3.5 or higher, Pip, and Flask
-The Whitestone application folders and its corresponding database

Installation Options

There are two options in order to install the Whitestone application. The path that you
must follow will depend on your current needs.

A. I need to install the Whitestone application from scratch

1. Create a CentOS 7 or RHEL 7 server instance. Install Apache and the corresponding SSL modules
in order to enable TLS. The explanation for this step is beyond the scope of this guide. Please
note that at the end of your ssl.conf file you must add the following:

        LoadModule cgi_module modules/mod_cgi.so
        LoadModule proxy_uwsgi_module modules/mod_proxy_uwsgi.so

        WSGIDaemonProcess main threads=5
        WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/html/Whitestone/Whitestone.wsgi
        WSGIScriptReloading On
        <Directory Whitestone>
                WSGIProcessGroup main
                WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
                Order allow,deny
                Deny from all
                Allow from 136.145.56.166
                Allow from 127
        </Directory>

</VirtualHost>

Please note that the Whitestone application requires the use of a RADIUS server for
authentication. That configuration is also beyond the scope of this guide. Make sure that your
certificate and key match the following names, or change them manually in main.py:

/etc/pki/tls/certs/whitestone.crt
/etc/pki/tls/certs/whitestone.key

2. Install the PostgreSQL database service using the following commands:
sudo yum install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib

3. Install Python 3.5, Pip, Flask, and all other necessary packages that support the execution
of the application. Run the following commands:
    sudo yum install yum-utils
    sudo yum install https://centos7.iuscommunity.org/ius-release.rpm
    sudo yum install python35u
    sudo yum install python35u-pip
    sudo yum install python35u-devel
    sudo pip3.5 install flask
    sudo pip3.5 install flask-cors
    sudo pip3.5 install py-radius
    sudo yum install git
    sudo yum install httpd
    sudo systemctl enable httpd
    sudo systemctl start httpd
    sudo systemctl enable postgresql
    sudo systemctl start postgresql
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload

4. Open the Whitestone_installation directory using the Terminal and navigate inside the folder.

5. Run the following commands:
    sudo chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh
    
6. Important note: After running the script you will be asked for:
     postgresql password = icom ,and then 
     whitestoneadmin password= capstone

6. The command above must have installed the clean Whitestone database and the Whitestone app in the directory /var/www/html


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To install the application from a restore file use the included restore.sh script with the default
installation as argument. This script will also create the Whitestone database along with
the required credentials and configurations. Please not that, even though the on-screen
instructions suggest that the script is used to restore the application from a previously
created backup, the default installation file should work as well.


If for any reason you decide to install the application manually, it is possible to do so.
After using tar to decompress the file, use the cp command. In order to avoid issues, we
recommend that you use the default folder for this purpose, which is /var/www/html.
Assuming that the folders have been uncompressed at /home/users, use the following:
cp -avr /home/users/Whitestone /var/www/html. You must then create a database called
"whitestone" using "whitestoneadmin" as user and password="capstone". For guidance on this section, we recommend that
you follow the commands used in the default .sql file included and the configuration found
inside your Whitestone/configs/dbconfig.py file. If yoy decided to used another different username or password you MUST change
parameter in the config file in order to the database to connect.

B. I need to install the Whitestone application from an existing backup

1. Install and configure your web server as described in steps 1-3 of part A if necessary.
2. Locate your .tar backup file and execute your restore.sh script. Follow the prompts
presented on-screen.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuring new computers to the Whitestone's local private network:

Accepting computer through iptables: 

iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -s <yourcomputeripaddress> --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -s <yourcomputeripaddress> --dport 80 -j ACCEPT

Denying computer access through iptables:

iptables -D INPUT -p tcp -m <yourcomputeripaddress> --dport 443 -j DROP
iptables -D INPUT -p tcp -m <yourcomputeripaddress> --dport 80 -j DROP


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To change the Login type from RADIUS to LOCAL or viceversa:
1. Open the class: login.js at /Whitestone/static/appjs
2. Change the  variable this.radiusLogin  =  true; or this.radiusLogin= false; 
3. Go to the function this.loginUser and change the variable data.login  =  "RADIUS"
 or data.login  =  "LOCAL"
